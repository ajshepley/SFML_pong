# SFML Pong
## **Deprecated/ancient school project.**

A simple implementation of Pong made in C++ using SFML.

Default tracking for the automatic second player, and basic vertical vector for ball and paddle acceleration.

Just a simple project whipped up in a day.

A windows binary is included; one can just use "make" to compile at a Linux terminal.

## Requirements

SFML 1.6, G++/GCC
